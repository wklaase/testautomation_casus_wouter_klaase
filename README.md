![Run docker-compose build](https://github.com/TestCoders/testautomation_casus/workflows/Run%20docker-compose%20build/badge.svg)

This project contains my integration tests for the IMTDB casus. You can find them in the v1/integrationtests directory.

Please see this wiki https://github.com/TestCoders/testautomation_casus/wiki for instructions on how to build and run the IMTDB itself.
